# Quick Deploy Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (30 seconds)

1. Open this link in your browser: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `project-protfolio`
3. Make it **Public**
4. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code (I'll do this automatically)

Once you create the repository, just type "done" in the chat and I'll immediately push your code.

---

**Why this is needed:** Your code is ready (148 files, no node_modules), but GitHub needs the repository to exist first before I can push to it.

**Time needed:** Less than 1 minute total!
